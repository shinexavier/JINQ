JINQ
====

**Javascript Integrated Query**

This is a JS library for manipulating data via Fluent Interfaces.

It is purely inspired by LINQ (Language Integrated Query) an important DotNET platform feature,
the very purpose, I believe, for which functional programming language features like 
Anonymous methods and Extension methods was created in CSharp (C#) Language.


I sincerely wish anyone who might find this useful would enjoy using this the same way I enjoyed 
creating it starting early Feb 2013.
